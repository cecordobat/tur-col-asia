# int-trade-states
So, the present code is a compilation well presented of the work that I did. 
My objective is to analyze the evolution of the international trade of Michigan and its neighbour states Wisconsin, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana. 
The data used are exports, imports and balance trade extracted by scrapping web tecnhniques from the USA Census Bureau. 
The data is monthly and posted online by the Census bureau in the same frequency. 
Hence, there were multiple files corresponding to monthly data for exports by origin of movement and imports by state destination both of them not seasonally adjusted. 
So, in order to learn and avoiding to download many files and joining them I applied scrapping web techniques that I learned from different sources 
and it was a magnific technique to learn in order to download public databases.
